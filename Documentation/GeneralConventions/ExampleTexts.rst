This is information about example texts and structure for **official
documentation** on the start page, in the menu etc. Extension
authors are free to do it differently, but using the same conventions
across all documentation on docs.typo3.org should make it easier for
users to find things quickly.

Start page
==========

For an example start page, see :ref:`t3tca:start`.

The following should be on the start page, typically in this order:

*  *required*: Title
*  *optional*: Quick links (as button style)
*  *required*: Description
*  *required*: Meta information, including language, author, license
   (required) and status, target audience etc. (optional)

   *  The author can contain a link to a section "Credits". If the
      author is "Documentation Team", it should be a link to the
      docs team page on typo3.org, not a link to the email address.

*  *required*: Link to sitemap (as button style)

*  *required*: (in sidebar with title "Contributors:") Link to
   information about contribution, link targets and the shortcut.

*  *required*: Official documentation.
*  *required*: Manual type, e.g. "Core Manual", "Tutorial", etc.
*  *optional*: Credits section and link to contributors on GitHub
*  *optional*: Short information about contribution (this should be
   very general so we do not have to change it often). This can be
   omitted as we already have the link to information about
   contribution in the sidebar.

Change history
--------------

These are some changes that we made for the following reasons:

*  **description** is now above the metadata and not within it because
   it very easily got overlooked there and shouuld stand out more
*  **Last rendered**, **version**, **copyright** and some others
   have been removed because they are already displayed in the footer
*  **Link to Link targets** is now on the start page because it has
   been removed in the menu. It should be in a box (sidebar) with
   title "Contributors"

See `decision: Proposal for documentation manual start page <https://decisions.typo3.org/t/proposal-for-documentation-manual-start-page/668>`__

.. exapmle-menu::

Menu
====

*  *required*: Should contain "Sitemap", typically as last item. The file name
   should be :file:`Documentation/Sitemap.rst` (which is already the convention
   in most official manuals
